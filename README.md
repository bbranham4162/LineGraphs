# PolarGraphs

+1 Hr Spent about an hour trying to come up with a design, looked at other coding projects to figure out how I can create classes that'll run my code smoothly.



+1 Hr 
Looked up videos for creating graphs could not find any videos describing how to create graphs with coding so started looking into Raylib

Helpful Library website code for Raylib: https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html

*** What I learned so far

Constants is my class for constant inputs used for creating my graph 

Idea is to create a grid using RayLib then DrawLines dependent on what r and theta are


*** +1 Hr

Figure out how to Draw a circle and that the window stays open as long as the program is running still trying to figure out how to keep the window open and if its possible without running the program

[Steps]
1. Fix Window Not responding (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70643032/raylib-making-the-barest-code-required-for-a-blank-window) Contains code showing how to fix it
2. Create function conversion method
3. Figure out how to graph a line when given a function in C#

*** Figured out how to Graph a line

+ 3 Hours I learned that by typing console.Readkey I could keep my program running until someone pressed any button to stop the program

- learned I can create a list to hold all my values that will enter into my function

? Ran into a snare where I struggled to figure out how I could enter a function as a parameter instead of an integer greatly hindering the types of functions I could create.

? Tried changing my window to allow for negative functions but couldn't figure out how 

- Created VideoService Class and added functions to graph a line, graphing pixels for every value

- Created parameter that allows for user to change the power of the function
