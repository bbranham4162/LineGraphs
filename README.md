Looked up videos for creating graphs could not find any videos describing how to create graphs with coding so started looking into Raylib

Helpful Library website code for Raylib: https://www.raylib.com/cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html

*** What I learned so far

Constants is my class for constant inputs used for creating my graph 

Idea is to create a grid using RayLib then DrawLines dependent on what r and theta are

Figure out how to Draw a circle and that the window stays open as long as the program is running still trying to figure out how to keep the window open and if its possible without running the program

[Steps]
1. Fix Window Not responding (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70643032/raylib-making-the-barest-code-required-for-a-blank-window) Contains code showing how to fix it
2. Create function conversion method
3. Figure out how to graph a line when given a function in C#
